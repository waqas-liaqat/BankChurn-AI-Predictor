## Problem Statement
Banks often struggle with retaining customers who might leave (churn). This project predicts whether a customer will churn based on demographic and transactional data, enabling proactive retention strategies.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** Kaggle
- Data [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbadole/bank-customer-churn-prediction-dataset)
- **Size:** 10,000 rows, 14 features
- **Key Features:**
  - **Numerical:** Age, CreditScore, Balance, EstimatedSalary
  - **Categorical:** Geography, Gender, Tenure, NumOfProducts
  - **Target Variable:** Exited (0 = Not Churned, 1 = Churned)

---

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Created age and balance categories.
   - Removed redundant features to prevent overfitting.
3. **Modeling:**
   - Tested multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).
   - Selected the best-performing model based on precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Deployment:**
   - Built an interactive web app using Streamlit.
   - Deployed on Streamlit Cloud for accessibility.

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Challenge:** Selecting optimal features without overfitting.
  - **Solution:** Iterative feature elimination using tree-based models.
- **Challenge:** Ensuring app usability for non-technical users.
  - **Solution:** Implemented clear instructions and user-friendly design.
- **Learning:** The importance of balancing interpretability and accuracy in model selection.

---

## Results
- **Model Performance:**
  - Accuracy: 87%
  - Precision: 84%
  - Recall: 79%
  - F1-Score: 81%
- **Key Insights:**
  - Age and geography were significant churn indicators.
  - Customers with high balances were less likely to churn.
